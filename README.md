# **A personal "tech portfolio analyzer" for recruiters!**

## **Core Concept**
A web platform where candidates submit links to their public profiles:
	• Blogging platforms: Hashnode / Medium
	• Code platforms: GitHub (top 3 repos), LeetCode / Codeforces
	• Social: Twitter (tech tweets), LinkedIn
Our backend will then fetch and analyze data from these links and assign a composite rating or profile score. This helps recruiters quickly assess if someone is worth shortlisting.!
